# Amazon Connect Campground for Service Cloud Voice

This repository contains examples, templates, packages, and documentation to help Service Cloud Voice customers address some common requirements and deploy more quickly. While the solutions here are designed specifically for Service Cloud Voice deployments they will all work for standard Amazon Connect + CTI examples as well and can also serve as a reference for non-Salesforce deployments.

The repository is divided into five sections:

- Common Resources: Provide underlying resources required for some of the solutions to work. Examples include a common authentication setup for these solutions, AWS Lambda depenedency layers, etc
- Solutions: larger solutions designed to address specific requirements that customers may have. These solutions are designed for operational use. Examples include Cross-Account SMS or Voicemail Express.
- Use Case Examples: small, simple examples to address basic configuration questions. These demonstrate an approach to solving a problem but have not necessarily been dessigned for operational use. Examples inclde dial-by-extension configurations and follow-me routing.
- Launch Packs: Launch Packs combine multiple templates together to bring feature sets into a singular deployment.
- AWS Best Practices for Service Cloud Voice: documents written by AWS solutions architects that demonstrate best practice design for specific Service Cloud Voice use cases.
